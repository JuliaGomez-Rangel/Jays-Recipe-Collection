Howdy,

This is a collection of recipes that I've gathered from various corners of the internet and would like to eventually try. They are organized by my heart so don't expect it to make any sense why the recipes are in the folders they are in. I'll try and update these recipes as I cook them and talk about any substitutes I made and how it ended up.

Nya~
