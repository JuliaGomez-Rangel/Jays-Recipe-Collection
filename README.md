Howdy,

This is a collection of recipes that I've gathered from various corners of the internet and would like to eventually try. They are organized by my heart so don't expect it to make any sense why the recipes are in the folders they are in. I'll try and update these recipes as I cook them and talk about any substitutes I made and how it ended up.

I'm using an app called Obsidian to note down these recipes so all of the recipes are in markdown files. They should be readable on GitHub but some of the Obsidian links are broken. I don't want to futz with fixing the links but it should be easy enough to find the recipe file.

Nya~
