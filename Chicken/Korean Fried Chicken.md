## Ingredients
- 2 pounds chicken breasts
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 cornstarch
- Vegetable Oil (for frying)
- Green onions
- Toasted sesame seeds
- Red chilis
## Instructions
1. Toss the chicken pieces through the egg first, then dredge through cornstarch.
2. Add about 3 inches of oil to a heavy bottom pan and heat to 375Â°F.
3. Add chicken to the pan and fry in batches about 3 to 4 minutes per batch. Transfer the chicken to a paper towel lined plate and repeat with remaining chicken.
4. Make [[Korean Fried Chicken Sauce]] and coat chicken in sauce.
5. Serve garnished with green onions, toasted sesame seeds and red chilis
## Pair with
- Hot white rice
- Banchan (Korean side dishes)
## Notes
1. My house doesn't have a vent hood and I wasn't interested in my house smelling like fry oil so I fried the chicken in the air fryer by spraying some cooking oil on the chicken before popping it into the air fryer. It wasn't as crispy as I think it was supposed to be and there was a bit of excess corn starch but otherwise it still offered a nice texture.
2. If you mix the sauce and the chicken in a separate bowl, be wary that the bowl will be hot because the sauce is hot.
## Thoughts
For having to change the recipe a bit due to using the air fryer and missing an ingredient or two, it ended up pretty well. I couldn't find red chilis so I ended up dicing some serrano. Went great with white rice. Now I just need to learn how to consistently make good white rice :(.
