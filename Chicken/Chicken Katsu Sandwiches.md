## Ingredients
### Breading
- Flour
- Corn Starch
- Egg
- Panko
- Salt & Pepper
### Toppings
- Cabbage or Lettuce (cut as thin as possible)
- Tomato (cut in slices to your preference)
- Chili Crisp
- Kewpie Mayo
### Basic Sandwich Components
- Fluffy thick bread (preferably sweet)
- Chicken Breast (or tenders)
## Instructions
1. Prepare you chicken by flattening/tenderizing the chicken until it is about 1cm thick (thinner is usually better just try not to tear the kitchen). If necessary, cut the chicken so it is about the size of the bread you are using.
2. Season the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides.
3. Grab three plates. In one plate, add one part flour and one part corn starch. In another plate, add an egg and whisk it until the yolk and white are combined. In the last plate, add the panko.
4. For each piece of chicken, first coat it in the flour/corn starch mixture, then the egg, then the panko.
5. Cook the chicken by frying it (either air-frying or traditional oil frying). REMEMBER: Chicken is cooked when its internal temp is 165. A meat thermometer is worth the purchase I swear.
6. Assemble your sandwiches to your taste, adding the sauces and toppings you like.

## Pair with
- Fries
- Chips
- Fruit
## Notes
1. The first few times you make this, you will likely make a huge mess and it will take forever. If you like the recipe, KEEP MAKING IT. Once you figure out a good process for yourself/your kitchen, it won't take nearly as much time and effort.
2. I didn't put measurements because this recipe is entirely based on how much you want. I usually make like 2 pounds of chicken at once which typically requires two eggs but I've also used a single serving of chicken from leftover to make one serving for myself.
3. I buy the Italian seasoned panko so my version is not very authentic. I'll also add paprika, chili powder, and cayenne to my flour/corn starch mixture. Again not very authentic but I'm American.
4. I prefer to air-fry my chicken. I haven't tried it yet but I saw someone coat their panko in oil before using it in the recipe. I'll try it and edit this entry to see if it makes a drastic difference.
