## Ingredients
- 5-6 Pita Breads or 6 Lebanese bread
- 500g (1lb) Minced Beef (or you can use lamb), get 80% meat : 20% fat, but 70:30 is ideal if you can find it
- 30g (1oz) Parsley
- 1 Medium brown onions
- 1-2 Garlic Cloves
- 1 1/2 Tbsp Pomegranate Molasses
- 25-50g Beef Fat or 2 Tbsp Olive oil (this is to increase the fat ratio, leave out if you want) 1 Tsp salt
- 1/2 Tsp Baharat (this is a Middle Eastern spice blend, but if you don't have this you can use all spice instead)
- 1/4 Tsp Black Pepper
- 1/4 Tsp Cayenne or chilli flakes 1/8 Tsp Cinnamon
- 2 Tbsp Olive oil for brushing the bread
## Instructions
### To make the meat filling:
1. Add your Onion and parsley to a food processor or blender, and process till very finely chopped
2. Crush the garlic cloves and add to a mixing bowl with the meat, onion mixture, pomegranate molasses, beef fat/olive oil, salt, baharat, black pepper, cayenne/chilli flakes and cinnamon. Mix together thoroughly until a uniform mixture forms
3. Cook a small piece of the meat in a pan and taste for seasoning. Adjust if necessary
### To prepare the Arayes:
4. First thing, test if your bread is fresh and you can easily pull the two layers apart, if not then microwave it for 30 seconds until piping hot, alternatively you can heat in a pan flipping occasionally. Don't separate the two layers just yet, you want to keep your bread intact
5. Slice your bread in half (if oval shaped) or into quarters (if circular) and then use a knife to pry both sides of the bread apart, you should open it from the seams where you sliced it and not the outer edge of the bread. Once you've managed to pull the two sides apart, open your bread up until a pocket forms or until you could easily get the filling in there
6. Add a few tablespoons of the meat filling to each pocket and massage it to the edges and back of the bread. For thicker pita aim to have the meat filling about 1cm (1/3in) thick, or 1/2cm (1/6in) thick for the paper thin Lebanese bread. Stuff the bread pieces till you have used up all of your meat mixture
7. Using a brush, or your hands, coat the surface of each stuffed pitta bread with olive oil until liberally oiled
### To cook the Arayes:
8. Preheat a grill pan (or a real grill) on medium high heat and when ready add your Arayes
9. Grill for 4 minutes and then flip once they start to sizzle (thinner bread will take about 3 minutes per side, on a real grill cook using a low heat)
10. Cook for the same amount of time on the other side and then remove from the pan
## Pair with

## Notes
1. Kofta is commonly known as Kabob (in the US) and Kebab (in europe), despite Kebab being the name given to grilled pieces of whole meat and not ground meat (ground is always called Kofta). In Turkey the rules regarding naming are also different.
2. If you want to make an approximation to Egyptian Hawawshi, add some more chilli flakes, baharat and two finely diced tomatoes
3. You can sub the pomegranate molasses with a balsamic vinegar reduction (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/6srhx1/is_there_a_suitable_alternative_to_pomegranate/). If you choose to reduce to the balsamic vinegar yourself, be cautious because it goes from good to burnt very quickly. You can also just buy balsamic vinegar reduction.
