## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 pounds flank steak (thinly sliced)
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
## Instructions
1. Make [[Korean Beef Bulgogi Marinade]]
2. Add beef to marinade and massage marinade into the beef. 
3. Seal (by covering bowl in plastic wrap or storing beef with marinade in plastic bag) and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 24 hours.
4. In a non-stick skillet add the sesame oil over high heat. Cook the meat in batches until slightly brown on both sides, 3 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Repeat with remaining meat.
## Pair with
- Hot white rice
- Banchan (Korean side dishes)
## Notes
1. I don't eat kiwis so I just grabbed a random kiwi. Find a relatively soft kiwi that you can feasibly mash with a fork.
2. STIR CONSTANTLY OR YOUR PAN WILL SUFFER.
3. Completely unrelated to the last note, if there is a bunch of char on the bottom of your pan, don't let the pan cool down, add water to the pan (about enough to cover the bottom) and scrape with wooden spoon. That will get rid of the worst of it.
## Thoughts
Yeah, it was fire. I ended up using the marinade with chicken instead of beef because it was cheaper and it was still good.
