## Ingredients
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 2 tablespoons mirin
- 6 cloves garlic
- 1 green onion
- 1/2 kiwi
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 2 teaspoons sesame seeds
## Instructions
1. Combine all the marinade ingredients together in a medium sized bowl and stir until combined.
## Notes
1. I don't eat kiwis so I just grabbed a random kiwi. Find a relatively soft kiwi that you can feasibly mash with a fork. I grabbed a relatively unripe kiwi and ended up chopping the kiwi to as small of pieces as I could. The website suggest putting it into a blender and giving it a few pulses but that's too much clean up for me.
2. You could also replace the kiwi with an Asian pear but kiwis are easier to find and probably cheaper.
3. I made the marinade in a gallon sized plastic bag so I didn't have to store the bowl in the fridge.
