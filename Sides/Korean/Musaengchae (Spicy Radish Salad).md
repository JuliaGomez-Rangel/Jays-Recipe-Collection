## Ingredients
- 1 pound mu (Korean radish)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 or 2 scallions finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons gochugaru
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1/2 teaspoon grated ginger
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce (myulchi aekjeot) or saeujeot (salted shrimp)
- 1 teaspoon sugar adjust to taste - see note
- 1 teaspoon sesame seeds optional
## Instructions
1. Clean the radish by scrubbing with a brush and/or scratching off the stubborn impurities with a small knife. Peel theÂ skin only if necessary. Cut into matchsticks (about 1/8 to 1/4-inch thick).
2. Sprinkle the salt over the radish and toss well to coat evenly. Let sit for about 20 minutes until the radish has softened and released some liquid. Drain excess liquid. Do not rinse.
3. Add all the remaining ingredients, except the scallion and sesame seeds. Mix well by hand. Taste and add more salt or fish sauce, if necessary.
4. Throw in the scallion and sesame seeds and toss everything well.
