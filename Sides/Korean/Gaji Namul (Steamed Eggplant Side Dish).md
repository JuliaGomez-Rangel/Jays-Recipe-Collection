## Ingredients
- 2 medium size Korean/Asian eggplants
- 1 scallion finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1-1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- ¼ teaspoon sugar
- ½ teaspoon gochugaru
- 1 teaspoon roasted sesame seeds
- pinch pepper
## Instructions
1. Cut the eggplants lengthwise in quarters. Then cut crosswise into about 2-inch pieces.
2. Boil the water in a pot with a steamer tier or basket over high heat, covered. Place the eggplant pieces in the steamer, and steam until softened but still a bit firm, about 3 minutes.
3. Transfer to a bowl to cool. Add all of the remaining ingredients and gently toss everything together. Add more soy sauce or gochugaru to taste if needed.
## Pair with
- Hot white rice
## Notes
1. If you don't own a steamer, you can steam the eggplant in the microwave. Put the eggplant in a "microwave safe" bowl with a little bit of water on the bottom and a wet paper towel on top. Put the eggplant in the microwave along with a microwave safe cup with some water. Cook in the 30 second increments, moving the eggplant around to ensure all the eggplant gets properly steamed, until the eggplants have softened but are firm when squeezed. Should take about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.
2. I couldn't get my hand on a korean/asian eggplant but the typical eggplant sold in American stores worked fine.
## Thoughts
This ended up better than I expected. Admittedly, I went into this dish not expecting to like it because I grew up not really liking the flavor of most of the food I ate at Asian restaurants to the point where I thought I didn't like Asian food. Turns out I do, or at the very least, I like being a part of the cooking process.
