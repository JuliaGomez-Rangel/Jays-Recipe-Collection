## Ingredients
- 1 bunch spinach (10 ounces)
- 1 scallion (chopped)
- 2 to 3 teaspoons gochujang
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon garlic (minced)
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon sesame seeds
## Instructions
1. Trim off the roots from the spinach. Wash thoroughly until there is no sand in the water. Blanch the spinach in salted boiling water until wilted, 20 to 30 seconds.
2. Quickly remove the spinach from the pot and shock in icy cold water to stop the cooking.
3. Drain and gently squeeze out excess water. Cut into 3-inch lengths.
4. Add the remaining ingredients and mix everything well by hand, loosening/separating the spinach pieces that have been clumped up together. It will take about 10 minutes for the flavor of the seasonings to seep into the spinach.

## Pair with
- Hot white rice (?)
## Thoughts
I did not expect to like this because it is a dish served cold and I generally dislike cold food but this was good. I really like it. Really fast and easy to make too.
