## Ingredients
- 1 pound cucumbers
- 1.5 teaspoons salt
- 1 tablespoon oil for stir-frying
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 small scallion finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds (preferably crushed)
## Instructions
1. Cut the cucumbers in half lengthwise, and then thinly slice crosswise slightly diagonally. If the cucumbers are thin, you can simply cut into thin rounds.
2. Lightly salt the cucumber slices with salt to coat evenly. Let sit for about 10 minutes.
3. Tightly squeeze out the water content from the salted cucumber slices. Donâ€™t worry about bruising them. They will bounce back when stir-fried.
4. Heat a pan over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan. Quickly stir in the garlic. Add the cucumbers. Stir-fry for a minute until the cucumbers are slightly cooked. Do not overcook. Turn off the heat. Toss well with the scallion, sesame oil, and sesame seeds.
